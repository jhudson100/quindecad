Glue
======

We need to do type checking and such on CSG functions that
the user calls before we hand the request to the Manifold
library. This directory contains files for autogenerating
the code that does this. There are several parts to the
autogenerated code. The main script is makeglue.py.


Input
-------

The input consists of Python files annotated with the expected
types. These files are stored in shims/.

Python
--------

The Python code (which is prepended to the user's code)
is generated by makepython.py (which is used by makeglue.py).
It scans the files in shims/ and concatenates the Python
code into one file. It removes docstrings and
type annotations and also inserts type checks to ensure
the parameters passed in match the expected types.

Documentation
----------------

In-program documentation data is generated by makedocfile.py
It scans the Python files in shims for docstrings and uses those
to document the functions.

Typescript
--------------

The code that actually calls Manifold is written in Typescript
and is generated by makets.py. This code scans the files
in shims/ and generates Typescript functions using the code
that is supplied inside each shim file (in the TS string).
